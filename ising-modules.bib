We show that there is a unique family of vertex algebras satisfying the required conditions and show that they are all simple and conformal. In fact, our construction works for any complex semisimple group G that is not necessarily simply laced. Furthermore, we show that the associated varieties of these vertex algebras are exactly the genus zero Moore-Tachikawa symplectic varieties that have been recently constructed by Braverman, Finkelberg and Nakajima using the geometry of the affine Grassmannian for the Langlands dual group.},

	abstract = {This paper begins with a brief survey of the period prior to and soon after the creation of the theory of vertex operator algebras (VOAs). This survey is intended to highlight some of the important developments leading to the creation of VOA theory. The paper then proceeds to describe progress made in the field of VOAs in the last 15 years which is based on fruitful analogies and connections between VOAs and commutative algebras. First, there are several functors from VOAs to commutative algebras that allow methods from commutative algebra to be used to solve VOA problems. To illustrate this, we present a method for describing orbifolds and cosets using methods of classical invariant theory. This was essential in the recent solution of a conjecture of Gaiotto and Rap{\textbackslash}v\{c\}{\textbackslash}'ak that is of current interest in physics. We also recast some old conjectures in the subject in terms of commutative algebra and give some generalizations of these conjectures. We also give an overview of the theory of topological VOAs (TVOAs), with applications to BRST cohomology theory and conformal string theory, based on work in the 90's. We construct a functor from TVOAs to Batalin-Vilkovisky algebras -- supercommutative algebras equipped with a certain odd Poisson structure realized by a second order differential operator -- and present a number of interesting applications. This paper is based in part on the lecture given by the first author at the Harvard CMSA Math-Science Literature Lecture Series on May 22, 2020.},

We prove that the associated graded superspace of our filtration has a structure of SUSY vertex Poisson algebras.

Beginning with the basic definitions and ring-module theoretic/homological properties, it goes on to investigate finitely generated projective modules over skew PBW extensions from a matrix point of view. To make this theory constructive, the theory of Gröbner bases of left (right) ideals and modules for bijective skew PBW extensions is developed. For example, syzygies and the Ext and Tor modules over these rings are computed. Finally, applications to some key topics in the noncommutative algebraic geometry of quantum algebras are given, including an investigation of semi-graded Koszul algebras and semi-graded Artin–Schelter regular algebras, and the noncommutative Zariski cancellation problem. The book is addressed to researchers in noncommutative algebra and algebraic geometry as well as to graduate students and advanced undergraduate students},

In this paper, the notions of vertex Lie algebra (conformal algebra) and vertex Poisson algebra are revisited and certain general construction theorems of vertex Poisson algebras are given. A notion of filtered vertex algebra is formulated in terms of a notion of good filtration and it is proved that the associated graded vector space of a filtered vertex algebra is naturally a vertex Poisson algebra. For any vertex algebra V, a general construction and a classification of good filtrations are given. To each ℕ-graded vertex algebra V=∐

              with [Formula: see text], a canonical (good) filtration is associated and certain results about generating subspaces of certain types of V are also obtained. Furthermore, a notion of formal deformation of a vertex (Poisson) algebra is formulated and a formal deformation of vertex Poisson algebras associated with vertex Lie algebras is constructed.},

The new approach says that a vertex algebra is an associative algebra such that the underlying Lie algebra is a vertex Lie algebra. In particular, vertex algebras can be formulated in terms of a single multiplication and they behave like associative algebras with respect to it. Chapter 1 is the introduction. In chapter 2 we discuss many examples of vertex Lie algebras and we show that vertex Lie algebras form a full subcategory of the category of "local" Lie algebras. In chapter 3 we introduce associative, commutative, and Poisson vertex algebras and vertex algebra modules and we show that graded associative vertex algebras form a full subcategory of the category of "local" associative algebras. In chapter 4 we give a systematic presentation of the vertex algebra identities, proving in particular the equivalence of various axiom systems, and we use filtrations to prove results about generating subspaces with the PBW-property, with and without repeats. In chapter 5 we explain three constructions of the enveloping vertex algebra of a vertex Lie algebra and prove the PBW-theorem. In chapter 6 we prove the Zhu correspondence between N-graded vertex algebra modules and modules over the Zhu algebra.},

In this paper, we focus on the construction of quantum vertex algebras over ℂ, whose notion was formulated in [23] with Etingof and Kazhdan's notion of quantum vertex operator algebra (over ℂ[[h]]) as one of the main motivations. As one of the main steps in constructing quantum vertex algebras, we prove that every countable-dimensional nonlocal (namely, noncommutative) vertex algebra over ℂ, which either is irreducible or has a basis of PBW type, is nondegenerate in the sense of Etingof and Kazhdan. Using this result, we establish the nondegeneracy of better known vertex operator algebras and some newly constructed nonlocal vertex algebras. We construct a family of quantum vertex algebras closely related to Zamolodchikov–Faddeev algebras.},

	abstract = {Previously we gave a proof of the Feigin--Fuchs character formula for the irreducible unitary discrete series of the Virasoro algebra with 0{\textless}c{\textless}1. The proof showed directly that the mutliplicity space arising in the coset construction of Goddard, Kent and Olive was irreducible, using the elementary part of the unitarity criterion of Friedan, Qiu and Shenker, giving restrictions on h for c=1-6/m(m+1) with m{\textgreater}2. In this paper we consider the same problem in the limiting case of the coset construction c=1. Using primary fields, we directly establish that the Virasoro algebra acts irreducibly on the multiplicity spaces of irreducible representations of SU(2) in the two level one irreducible representations of the corresponding affine Kac--Moody algebra. This gives a direct proof that the only singular vectors in these representations are those given by Goldstone's formulas, which also play an important part in the proof. For this proof, the theory is developed from scratch in a self-contained semi-expository way. Using the Jantzen filtration and the Kac determinant formula, we give an additional independent proof for the case c=1 which generalises to the case 0{\textless}c{\textless}1, where it provides an alternative approach to that of Astashkevich.},

	abstract = {In Section 1 we review various equivalent definitions of a vertex algebra V. The main novelty here is the definition in terms of an indefinite integral of the λ-bracket. In Section 2 we construct, in the most general framework, the Zhu algebra ZhuΓV, an associative algebra which “controls” Γ-twisted representations of the vertex algebra V with a given Hamiltonian operator H. An important special case of this construction is the H-twisted Zhu algebra ZhuHV. In Section 3 we review the theory of non-linear Lie conformal algebras (respectively non-linear Lie algebras). Their universal enveloping vertex algebras (resp. universal enveloping algebras) form an important class of freely generated vertex algebras (resp. PBW generated associative algebras). We also introduce the H-twisted Zhu non-linear Lie algebra ZhuHR of a non-linear Lie conformal algebra R and we show that its universal enveloping algebra is isomorphic to the H-twisted Zhu algebra of the universal enveloping vertex algebra of R. After a discussion of the necessary cohomological material in Section 4, we review in Section 5 the construction and basic properties of affine and finite W-algebras, obtained by the method of quantum Hamiltonian reduction. Those are some of the most intensively studied examples of freely generated vertex algebras and PBW generated associative algebras. Applying the machinery developed in Sections 3 and 4, we then show that the H-twisted Zhu algebra of an affine W-algebra is isomorphic to the finite W-algebra, attached to the same data. In Section 6 we define the Zhu algebra of a Poisson vertex algebra, and we discuss quasiclassical limits. In the Appendix, the equivalence of three definitions of a finite W-algebra is established.},

            The symmetric algebra \$\{{\textbackslash}mathcal\{S\}\}(\{\{{\textbackslash}mathfrak\{g\}\}\})\$ of a reductive Lie algebra \$\{\{{\textbackslash}mathfrak\{g\}\}\}\$ is equipped with the standard Poisson structure, that is, the Lie–Poisson bracket. Poisson-commutative subalgebras of \$\{{\textbackslash}mathcal\{S\}\}(\{\{{\textbackslash}mathfrak\{g\}\}\})\$ attract a great deal of attention because of their relationship to integrable systems and, more recently, to geometric representation theory. The transcendence degree of a Poisson-commutative subalgebra \$\{{\textbackslash}mathcal C\}{\textbackslash}subset\{{\textbackslash}mathcal\{S\}\}(\{\{{\textbackslash}mathfrak\{g\}\}\})\$ is bounded by the “magic number” \$\{{\textbackslash}boldsymbol\{b\}\}(\{\{{\textbackslash}mathfrak\{g\}\}\})\$ of \$\{\{{\textbackslash}mathfrak\{g\}\}\}\$. There are two classical constructions of \${\textbackslash}mathcal C\$ with \$\{{\textbackslash}textrm\{tr.deg\}\}{\textbackslash},\{{\textbackslash}mathcal C\}=\{{\textbackslash}boldsymbol\{b\}\}(\{\{{\textbackslash}mathfrak\{g\}\}\})\$. The 1st one is applicable to \${\textbackslash}mathfrak\{gl\}\_n\$ and \${\textbackslash}mathfrak\{so\}\_n\$ and uses the Gelfand–Tsetlin chains of subalgebras. The 2nd one is known as the “argument shift method” of Mishchenko–Fomenko. We generalise the Gelfand–Tsetlin approach to chains of almost arbitrary symmetric subalgebras. Our method works for all types. Starting from a symmetric decompositions \$\{\{{\textbackslash}mathfrak\{g\}\}\}=\{\{{\textbackslash}mathfrak\{g\}\}\}\_0{\textbackslash}oplus\{\{{\textbackslash}mathfrak\{g\}\}\}\_1\$, Poisson-commutative subalgebras \$\{\{{\textbackslash}mathcal\{Z\}\}\},{\textbackslash}tilde\{\{{\textbackslash}mathcal\{Z\}\}\}{\textbackslash}subset\{{\textbackslash}mathcal\{S\}\}(\{\{{\textbackslash}mathfrak\{g\}\}\}){\textasciicircum}\{\{\{{\textbackslash}mathfrak\{g\}\}\}\_0\}\$ of the maximal possible transcendence degree are constructed. If the \$\{\{{\textbackslash}mathbb\{Z\}\}\}\_2\$-contraction \$\{\{{\textbackslash}mathfrak\{g\}\}\}\_0{\textbackslash}ltimes\{\{{\textbackslash}mathfrak\{g\}\}\}\_1{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}textsf\{ab\}\}\$ has a polynomial ring of symmetric invariants, then \${\textbackslash}tilde\{\{{\textbackslash}mathcal\{Z\}\}\}\$ is a polynomial maximal Poisson-commutative subalgebra of \$\{{\textbackslash}mathcal\{S\}\}(\{\{{\textbackslash}mathfrak\{g\}\}\}){\textasciicircum}\{\{\{{\textbackslash}mathfrak\{g\}\}\}\_0\}\$ and its free generators are explicitly described.},

	abstract = {We construct new families of positive energy representations of affine vertex algebras together with their free field realizations by using localization technique. We introduce the twisting functor \$\$T\_{\textbackslash}alpha \$\$on the category of modules over the universal affine vertex algebra \$\${\textbackslash}mathcal \{V\}\_{\textbackslash}kappa ({\textbackslash}mathfrak \{g\})\$\$of level \$\${\textbackslash}kappa \$\$for any positive root \$\${\textbackslash}alpha \$\$of \$\${\textbackslash}mathfrak \{g\}\$\$, and the Wakimoto functor from a certain category of \$\${\textbackslash}mathfrak \{g\}\$\$-modules to the category of \$\${\textbackslash}mathcal \{V\}\_{\textbackslash}kappa ({\textbackslash}mathfrak \{g\})\$\$-modules. These two functors commute (taking a proper restriction of \$\$T\_{\textbackslash}alpha \$\$on \$\${\textbackslash}mathfrak g\$\$-modules) and the image of the Wakimoto functor consists of relaxed Wakimoto \$\${\textbackslash}widehat\{{\textbackslash}mathfrak \{g\}\}\_{\textbackslash}kappa \$\$-modules. In particular, applying the twisting functor \$\$T\_{\textbackslash}alpha \$\$to the relaxed Wakimoto \$\${\textbackslash}widehat\{{\textbackslash}mathfrak \{g\}\}\_{\textbackslash}kappa \$\$-module whose top degree component is isomorphic to the Verma \$\${\textbackslash}mathfrak \{g\}\$\$-module \$\$M{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}mathfrak \{g\}\_{\textbackslash}mathfrak \{b\}({\textbackslash}lambda )\$\$, we obtain the relaxed Wakimoto \$\${\textbackslash}widehat\{{\textbackslash}mathfrak \{g\}\}\_{\textbackslash}kappa \$\$-module whose top degree component is isomorphic to the \$\${\textbackslash}alpha \$\$-Gelfand–Tsetlin \$\${\textbackslash}mathfrak \{g\}\$\$-module \$\$W{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}mathfrak \{g\}\_{\textbackslash}mathfrak \{b\}({\textbackslash}lambda , {\textbackslash}alpha )\$\$. We show that the relaxed Verma module and relaxed Wakimoto module whose top degree components are such \$\${\textbackslash}alpha \$\$-Gelfand–Tsetlin modules, are isomorphic generically. This is an analogue of the result of E. Frenkel for Wakimoto modules both for critical and non-critical level. For a parabolic subalgebra \$\${\textbackslash}mathfrak \{p\}\$\$of \$\${\textbackslash}mathfrak \{g\}\$\$we construct a new large family of positive energy representations of the simple affine vertex algebra \$\${\textbackslash}mathcal \{L\}\_{\textbackslash}kappa ({\textbackslash}mathfrak \{g\})\$\$of admissible level \$\${\textbackslash}kappa \$\$by means of the twisting functor applied on generalized Verma modules for the parabolic subalgebra \$\${\textbackslash}mathfrak \{p\}\$\$.},

The singular support of \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{V\}\$ is the spectrum of the associated graded algebra \${\textbackslash}text\{gr\}({\textbackslash}mathcal\{V\})\$ with respect to Li's canonical decreasing filtration. There is a closed embedding from the singular support to the arc space of the associated scheme, which is an isomorphism in many interesting cases. In this note we give an example of a non-quasi-lisse vertex algebra whose associated scheme is reduced, for which the isomorphism is not true as schemes but true as varieties.},

We determine explicitly the flat connections that these homologies acquire under smooth variation of the elliptic curve, as insertions of the conformal vector and the Weierstrass \${\textbackslash}zeta\$ function. We construct linear functionals associated to self-extensions of V-modules and prove their convergence under said finiteness conditions. These linear functionals turn out to be degree 1 analogs of the n-point functions in the degree 0 case. As a corollary we prove the vanishing of the first chiral homology group of an elliptic curve with values in several rational vertex algebras, including affine \$sl\_2\$ at non-negative integral level, the (2,2k+1)-minimal models and arbitrary simple affine vertex algebras at level 1. Of independent interest, we prove a Fourier space version of the Borcherds formula.},

We find, as consequences, an explicit monomial basis for the Ising model and a description of its singular support. We find that the ideal sheaf of the latter, defining it as a subscheme of the arc space of its associated scheme, is finitely generated as a differential ideal. We prove three new \$q\$-series identities of the Rogers–Ramanujan–Slater type associated with the three irreducible modules of the Virasoro Lie algebra of central charge \$1/2\$. We give a combinatorial interpretation to the identity associated with the vacuum module.},

abstract="We argue that rational conformally invariant quantum field theories in two dimensions are closely related to torsion elements of the algebraic K-theory group K3(C). If such a field theory has an integrable perturbation with purely elastic scattering matrix, then its partition function has a canonical sum representation. The corresponding asymptotic behaviour of the density of states is given in terms of the solutions of an algebraic equation which can be read off from the scattering matrix. These solutions yield torsion elements of an extension of the Bloch group which seems to be equal to K3(C). The algebraic equations are solved for integrable models given by arbitrary pairs of A-type Cartan matrices. The paper should be readable by mathematicians.",
