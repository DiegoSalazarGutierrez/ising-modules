We show that we may consider U as a subset U ⊂ V (U) which generates V(U) and that the vertex Lie algebra structure on U is induced by the vertex algebra structure on V(U). Moreover, for any vertex algebra V a given homomorphism U → V of vertex Lie algebras extends uniquely to a homomorphism V(U) → V of vertex algebras. In the second part of paper we study under what conditions on structure constants one can construct a vertex Lie algebra U by starting with a given commutator formula for fields.},

We apply this result to prove that the tensor product of Poisson PI algebras is a PI-algebra.

We compute an explicit third order deformation quantization of A and show that it comes from a quantized enveloping algebra. We show that this deformation extends to a fourth order deformation if and only if the quantized enveloping algebra gives a fourth order deformation; moreover we give an example where the deformation does not extend. A correction term to the third order quantization given by the enveloping algebra is computed, which precisely cancels the obstruction, so that the modified third order deformation extends to a fourth order one. The solution is generically unique, up to equivalence.},

These null operators are related to null vectors in the unitary representations of the discrete series of the Virasoro algebra. Each such representation possesses two leading null vectors. In the representation with the highest weight hp,q=[((m+1)p−mq)2−1]/4m(m+1), these null vectors are labeled ψp,q and ψm−p,m+1−q. We give the explicit expression for the null vectors ψp,1 and ψ1,m+1−q, i.e. for q=1 or p=m−1 respectively and show how they can be used to construct correlation functions of degenerate theories.},

The associated scheme of V\$\$\{{\textbackslash}backslashmathcal V\}\$\$is the spectrum of Zhu's Poisson algebra RV\$\$R\_\{\{{\textbackslash}backslashmathcal V\}\}\$\$. The singular support of V\$\$\{{\textbackslash}backslashmathcal V\}\$\$is the spectrum of the associated graded algebra gr(V)\$\${\textbackslash}backslashtext\{gr\}(\{{\textbackslash}backslashmathcal V\})\$\$with respect to Li's canonical decreasing filtration. There is a closed embedding from the singular support to the arc space of the associated scheme, which is an isomorphism in many interesting cases. In this note we give an example of a non-quasi-lisse vertex algebra whose associated scheme is reduced, for which the isomorphism is not true as schemes but true as varieties.},

	abstract = {Previously we gave a proof of the Feigin--Fuchs character formula for the irreducible unitary discrete series of the Virasoro algebra with 0{\textless}c{\textless}1. The proof showed directly that the mutliplicity space arising in the coset construction of Goddard, Kent and Olive was irreducible, using the elementary part of the unitarity criterion of Friedan, Qiu and Shenker, giving restrictions on h for c=1-6/m(m+1) with m{\textgreater}2. In this paper we consider the same problem in the limiting case of the coset construction c=1. Using primary fields, we directly establish that the Virasoro algebra acts irreducibly on the multiplicity spaces of irreducible representations of SU(2) in the two level one irreducible representations of the corresponding affine Kac--Moody algebra. This gives a direct proof that the only singular vectors in these representations are those given by Goldstone's formulas, which also play an important part in the proof. For this proof, the theory is developed from scratch in a self-contained semi-expository way. Using the Jantzen filtration and the Kac determinant formula, we give an additional independent proof for the case c=1 which generalises to the case 0{\textless}c{\textless}1, where it provides an alternative approach to that of Astashkevich.},

We show that there is a unique family of vertex algebras satisfying the required conditions and show that they are all simple and conformal. In fact, our construction works for any complex semisimple group G that is not necessarily simply laced. Furthermore, we show that the associated varieties of these vertex algebras are exactly the genus zero Moore-Tachikawa symplectic varieties that have been recently constructed by Braverman, Finkelberg and Nakajima using the geometry of the affine Grassmannian for the Langlands dual group.},

	abstract = {This paper begins with a brief survey of the period prior to and soon after the creation of the theory of vertex operator algebras (VOAs). This survey is intended to highlight some of the important developments leading to the creation of VOA theory. The paper then proceeds to describe progress made in the field of VOAs in the last 15 years which is based on fruitful analogies and connections between VOAs and commutative algebras. First, there are several functors from VOAs to commutative algebras that allow methods from commutative algebra to be used to solve VOA problems. To illustrate this, we present a method for describing orbifolds and cosets using methods of classical invariant theory. This was essential in the recent solution of a conjecture of Gaiotto and Rap{\textbackslash}v\{c\}{\textbackslash}'ak that is of current interest in physics. We also recast some old conjectures in the subject in terms of commutative algebra and give some generalizations of these conjectures. We also give an overview of the theory of topological VOAs (TVOAs), with applications to BRST cohomology theory and conformal string theory, based on work in the 90's. We construct a functor from TVOAs to Batalin-Vilkovisky algebras -- supercommutative algebras equipped with a certain odd Poisson structure realized by a second order differential operator -- and present a number of interesting applications. This paper is based in part on the lecture given by the first author at the Harvard CMSA Math-Science Literature Lecture Series on May 22, 2020.},

	abstract = {Any vertex algebra has a canonical decreasing filtration, called Li filtration, whose associated graded space has a natural structure of a vertex Poisson algebra. In this note, we introduce an analogous filtration for any SUSY vertex algebra, which was introduced by Heluani and Kac as a superfield formalism of a supersymmetric vertex algebra. We prove that the associated graded superspace of our filtration has a structure of SUSY vertex Poisson algebras. We also introduce and discuss related notions, such as Zhu's \$C\_2\$-Poisson superalgebras, associated superschemes and singular supports, for SUSY vertex algebras.},

Beginning with the basic definitions and ring-module theoretic/homological properties, it goes on to investigate finitely generated projective modules over skew PBW extensions from a matrix point of view. To make this theory constructive, the theory of Gröbner bases of left (right) ideals and modules for bijective skew PBW extensions is developed. For example, syzygies and the Ext and Tor modules over these rings are computed. Finally, applications to some key topics in the noncommutative algebraic geometry of quantum algebras are given, including an investigation of semi-graded Koszul algebras and semi-graded Artin–Schelter regular algebras, and the noncommutative Zariski cancellation problem. The book is addressed to researchers in noncommutative algebra and algebraic geometry as well as to graduate students and advanced undergraduate students},
