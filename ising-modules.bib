In this paper, the notions of vertex Lie algebra (conformal algebra) and vertex Poisson algebra are revisited and certain general construction theorems of vertex Poisson algebras are given. A notion of filtered vertex algebra is formulated in terms of a notion of good filtration and it is proved that the associated graded vector space of a filtered vertex algebra is naturally a vertex Poisson algebra. For any vertex algebra V, a general construction and a classification of good filtrations are given. To each ℕ-graded vertex algebra V=∐

	abstract = {In Section 1 we review various equivalent definitions of a vertex algebra V. The main novelty here is the definition in terms of an indefinite integral of the λ-bracket. In Section 2 we construct, in the most general framework, the Zhu algebra ZhuΓV, an associative algebra which “controls” Γ-twisted representations of the vertex algebra V with a given Hamiltonian operator H. An important special case of this construction is the H-twisted Zhu algebra ZhuHV. In Section 3 we review the theory of non-linear Lie conformal algebras (respectively non-linear Lie algebras). Their universal enveloping vertex algebras (resp. universal enveloping algebras) form an important class of freely generated vertex algebras (resp. PBW generated associative algebras). We also introduce the H-twisted Zhu non-linear Lie algebra ZhuHR of a non-linear Lie conformal algebra R and we show that its universal enveloping algebra is isomorphic to the H-twisted Zhu algebra of the universal enveloping vertex algebra of R. After a discussion of the necessary cohomological material in Section 4, we review in Section 5 the construction and basic properties of affine and finite W-algebras, obtained by the method of quantum Hamiltonian reduction. Those are some of the most intensively studied examples of freely generated vertex algebras and PBW generated associative algebras. Applying the machinery developed in Sections 3 and 4, we then show that the H-twisted Zhu algebra of an affine W-algebra is isomorphic to the finite W-algebra, attached to the same data. In Section 6 we define the Zhu algebra of a Poisson vertex algebra, and we discuss quasiclassical limits. In the Appendix, the equivalence of three definitions of a finite W-algebra is established.},

            We prove a new quasiparticle sum expression for the character of the Ising model vertex algebra, related to the Jackson–Slater \$q\$-series identity of Rogers–Ramanujan type and to Nahm sums for the matrix \${\textbackslash}left ({\textbackslash}begin \{smallmatrix\}8\&3{\textbackslash}{\textbackslash}3\&2 {\textbackslash}end \{smallmatrix\}{\textbackslash}right ) \$. We find, as consequences, an explicit monomial basis for the Ising model and a description of its singular support. We find that the ideal sheaf of the latter, defining it as a subscheme of the arc space of its associated scheme, is finitely generated as a differential ideal. We prove three new \$q\$-series identities of the Rogers–Ramanujan–Slater type associated with the three irreducible modules of the Virasoro Lie algebra of central charge \$1/2\$. We give a combinatorial interpretation to the identity associated with the vacuum module.},

If such a field theory has an integrable perturbation with purely elastic scattering matrix, then its partition function has a canonical sum representation. The corresponding asymptotic behaviour of the density of states is given in terms of the solutions of an algebraic equation which can be read off from the scattering matrix. These solutions yield torsion elements of an extension of the Bloch group which seems to be equal to K3(C). The algebraic equations are solved for integrable models given by arbitrary pairs of A-type Cartan matrices. The paper should be readable by mathematicians.",
